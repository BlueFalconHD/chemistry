Stoichemtry:

s1:   g of substance --(molar mass)-> mols of substance --(coefficients)-> mols of another substance --(molar mass)-> g of another substance

Need: target (c or d), mols of a and b, molar mass of a and b
a + b -> c + d

do s1 for a and b to target

- get smaller result, that is LR, other is XS
- XS result is trash
- LR result is theoretical yield
- go from LR to XS and subtract from initial mols of xs to get excess of reaction
